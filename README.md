# HeartsUp V2
An iOS App that can help you notify others in the event that you think you are having a Heart Attack.

The application runs on iOS 10.0+ EXCLUSIVELY ON iPhones (Requires text messaging services to run)

This application can be simply downloaded and imported into Xcode 8+, from where you may compile it to your own device that fits the aforementioned criteria.

This application is a redesign of [HeartsUp V1](https://github.com/Hearts-Up/hearts-up "HeartsUp V1"), an application which was originally intended to make use of the FitBit API to monitor heart rate and automatically notify others. Unfortunately, due time constraints, we were unable to program the application to access FitBit's OAuth servers or automatically send a text message.
